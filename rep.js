// The Eloquent Javascript
// Chapter 1 Summary

// We looked at four types of JavaScript values in this chapter: numbers, strings, Booleans, and undefined values.
// Such values are created by typing in their name (true, null) or value (13, "abc"). You can combine and transform values with operators. 
// We saw binary operators for arithmetic (+, -, *, /, and %), string concate- nation (+), comparison (==, !=, ===, !==, <, >, <=, >=), and
// logic (&&, ||), as well as several unary operators (- to negate a number, ! to negate logically, and typeof to find a valueâ€™s type) and
// a ternary operator (?:) to pick one of two values based on a third value.

// This gives you enough information to use JavaScript as a pocket calculator but not much more.
// The next chapter will start tying these expressions together into basic programs.
